// G-H4: the connection service used to wrap EVERY non-transient failure as
// "invalid credentials: …", and that string is the first entry of the
// errsanitize table, so it won. A Spotware outage, a missing
// CTRADER_CLIENT_ID, a cTID with no trading account and a 429 all reached the
// user as a 400 "invalid credentials" — advice that is not merely unhelpful
// for an OAuth broker, it is impossible to act on: the user has just
// completed a successful Spotware login and holds no credential to correct.
